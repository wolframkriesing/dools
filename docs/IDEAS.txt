Customization
- tagging
  - adding tags to methods, classes, modules, properties
    e.g. tag dojo.xhr with "ajax", "asynch", "remote", etc.
  - allow searching by tags, if searching for "ajax" you will also find dojo.xhr
- extract lines that start with "TODO" or "FIXXME" or alikes...

- Plugin API for:  
	- custom views
  		- I (wolfram) want to create a view template which lists methods, properties like ddotjs.org/api-overview does
    		whcih allows quick filtering and autoexpands if a small number of search results are found
	- adding tabs to the tool tab container
	- subscribing to Viewer and other core topics
		- e.g. plugin to integrate with trac and related tickets
		- offline search, gears driven
		- offline notes, gears driven
		- public comments interface
		- live chat/support - cometd
		- live editing
		- custom left navigation
	- CSS documentation
		- CSS parsing
	- Local caching via Gears
	- Editor integration
	- printer friendly view
