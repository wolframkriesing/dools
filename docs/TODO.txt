TODO
- add markup parser again to DojoDocStringParser, make fit in the new structure
- show parameters like dojo.__IoCallbackArgs in http://archive.dojotoolkit.org/nightly/dojotoolkit/dojo/_base/xhr.js
- get docstrings for inherited methods stuff

- store+restore last selected tabs in the left panel in a cookie
- store+restore status of right and left panel (opened/closed)
- autodetecting a namespace and creating the tree
- add another type "mixin"

FOR THE TREE
- dojo.isSafari, etc, see hostenv_browser.js they are in there but the reflection doesnt find them (of course)
  possible solution, before starting the reflection execute the pieces of code that are inside /*==== comments
- the structures that are documented inside, like dojo.__XhrArgs, etc.
- in dojo.dnd there are autoscroll.js and common.js we dont handle them yet ...
- handle Nodelist-fxand NodeList-html


DONE
- uxebu.docs.Summary
